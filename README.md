## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
```

### Running n8n using Docker Compose

#### For Nvidia GPU users

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://docs.ollama.com/docker).


### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```


#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose up
```

##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable

1. Set OLLAMA_HOST to `host.docker.internal:11434` in your .env file.
2. Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

    1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
    2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
    3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For Intel GPU users

The `gpu-localai` branch uses LocalAI's official Intel GPU image instead of the
retired IPEX-LLM portable Ollama build. LocalAI exposes its Ollama-compatible
API as `ollama:11434` for the bundled n8n workflow, which is a Basic LLM Chain
and does not send tool definitions or tool calls. This keeps the included
credential and basic chat workflow working without a second inference
credential.

This branch does not claim tool-calling compatibility through n8n's Ollama
nodes. Certify that path separately before replacing an agent workflow's model.

Builders evaluating that path can pair an Ollama client with
[pi0n00r/llm_proxy](https://github.com/pi0n00r/llm_proxy), which translates
Ollama chat and tool-call traffic to an OpenAI-compatible backend. The proxy is
an optional external component: it is not bundled or configured by this starter
kit.

The combined n8n Ollama node -> `llm_proxy` -> LocalAI Intel path remains
unclaimed and uncertified until it passes an end-to-end tool-calling test.

```bash
git clone --branch gpu-localai https://github.com/pi0n00r/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # update the secrets and passwords before starting
docker compose --profile gpu-intel up -d
```

The host must expose an Intel render device:

```bash
test -e /dev/dri/renderD128
```

The Compose profile passes `/dev/dri` into
`localai/localai:v4.7.1-gpu-intel` without granting the container privileged
access. It persists model and application data in the `localai_models` and
`localai_data` volumes. The included model definition:

- imports `llama3.2` from the Ollama registry;
- offloads all available layers to the Intel GPU;
- disables `mmap`, which LocalAI documents as unsafe for Intel SYCL; and
- uses one CPU thread while inference is GPU-offloaded.

The first model request can take several minutes while LocalAI downloads the
model and Intel backend. Follow startup with:

```bash
docker compose --profile gpu-intel logs -f localai-intel
```

Verify the API and GPU path:

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:11434/readyz
curl --fail http://localhost:11434/api/tags
docker compose exec localai-intel sh -lc \
  'test -e /dev/dri/renderD128 && echo "Intel render device present"'
```

A successful readiness probe proves that LocalAI is serving. Confirm Intel
offload separately in the LocalAI logs; readiness alone does not prove that the
model avoided CPU fallback.

#### For everyone else

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ⚡️ Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You’ll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you’re running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until the selected inference runtime finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can
   inspect the Docker console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you’ll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it’s not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## 🚧 Experimental Release: Intel GPU Support

> **Note:** LocalAI Intel GPU support is available as an experimental feature
> in this branch (`gpu-localai`). The Compose and configuration paths are
> statically validated, but must still be runtime-certified on a host with an
> Intel render device. Bug reports and contributions are welcome.

Run it with:

```bash
docker compose --profile gpu-intel up
```

## Upgrading

The Intel profile uses a versioned LocalAI image and does not build a local
inference image. Pull the image for the selected profile before recreating its
services.

* ### For NVIDIA GPU setups:

```bash
docker compose build --pull
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

* ### For AMD GPU setups:

```bash
docker compose build --pull
docker compose --profile gpu-amd pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

* ### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose create && docker compose up
```

* ### For Intel GPU users

```bash
docker compose --profile gpu-intel pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile gpu-intel up
```

* ### For Non-GPU setups:

```bash
docker compose build --pull
docker compose --profile cpu pull
docker compose create && docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you’ll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.
